  <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
  <p>It’s no debate that gentrification is transforming New York City everyday. The question, however, is whether or not
    gentrification is hurting or improving the lives of the City’s 8 million inhabitants. This question has been the
    source of endless debate as city officials try to decide on the best urban legislation for their constituents. To
    add productive commentary to this debate, we aim to show the impact of gentrification based on different key data
    points, such as income, demographics, poverty, and population. This project will serve to educate the common public
    about gentrification and hopefully inspire them to understand the impact of gentrification in their own communities.
  </p>
  <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
  <p>Primary Objectives</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How has gentrification changed in NYC over time?</li>
    <li>How can we visualize gentrification in NYC?</li>
    <li>What are some other metrics that might have been impacted by gentrification?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What We Want To Learn</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does gentrification have a positive or negative impact on NYC over time?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What we want to accomplish</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mainly, we seek to build a competent visualization that enables people to explore gentrification across
      different neighborhoods over time in NYC. By doing this, we hope that our work will spark new insight into the
      ongoing debate over the effects of gentrification on the people of NYC and beyond.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Benefits</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The debate over gentrification has some people against gentrification while others are for it. Our visualization
      seeks to inspire additional commentary in this ongoing debate by showing people the different ways in which
      gentrification may affect residents in gentrified areas</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <a
    href="http://app.coredata.nyc/?mlb=false&ntii=&ntr=&mz=14&vtl=https%3A%2F%2Fthefurmancenter.carto.com%2Fu%2Fnyufc%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fviz%2F691a2b7c-94d7-46ac-ac4d-9a589cb2c6ed%2Fviz.json&mln=false&mlp=true&mlat=40.718&ptsb=&nty=&mb=roadmap&pf=%7B%22subsidies%22%3Atrue%7D&md=map&mlv=false&mlng=-73.996&btl=Borough&atp=properties">CoreData.nyc</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Population (2005-2017)</li>
    <li>Changing Median Household Income (2001-2017)</li>
    <li>Racial Diversity Index (2005-2017)</li>
    <li>Unemployment Rate (2005-2017)</li>
    <li>Poverty Rate (2005-2017)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>Even though most of our data comes from the same source, different pieces of data are found in separate files from
    each other. Data processing will be implemented by individually parsing the separate files and combining the
    relevant data into one monolithic data source in order to make it easier for us to work with the data in D3.
    We are particularly interested in general data that are indicators of gentrification in NYC:
    Population throughout time,
    Median Household Income throughout time,
    Racial Diversity Index throughout time,
    Unemployment Rate throughout time,
    Poverty Rate throughout time.
  </p>

  <h2>Visualization Design</h2>
  <p>Must-Have Features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interactive map of NYC that visualizes GeoJSON of boroughs, sub-boroughs, or other districts</li>
    <li>The ability to select the gentrification attribute(s) that you are most interested in</li>
    <li>Showing how certain attribute(s) have changed over time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Optional Features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to compare the education attributes of different sub-boroughs/boroughs</li>
    <li>Include other types of data related to the indirect effects of gentrification</li>
    <li>Visualize educational data alongside gentrification data</li>
    <span>Certain features of our datasets are telltale signs of gentrification (e.g. housing prices and income of an
      area), so it could be useful to show how much these features have changed overtime along with the education data
      like test scores, graduation rates, etc.</span>

  <h2>Milestone One</h2>
  <img src="milestone_one.png" id="five" />
  <p>So far, we have been able to stick to our original 3-panel design. Users can select a gentrification attribute from
    the sidepanel and then select a specific NYC neighborhood in order to display a timeseries datachart of whatever
    data is selected. Currently, our timeseries chart just shows the income data for each subborough, but we plan on
    dynamically changing this data in the next milestone. One design idea we are currently experimenting with is to
    generate a "gentrification score" from multiple selected attributes and apply this score to a color scale that can
    illustrate which neighborhoods in NYC are exhibiting the highest amounts of gentrification. In the picture above,
    for example, a gentrification score is generated for Median Household Income and Poverty Rate. We are still
    researching ways in which we can make a reliable gentrification score that makes the most sense to users, so
    currently we are just averaging the values of whatever metrics are selected. One feature that we weren't yet able to
    implement was the timeline feature that allows users to explore NYC data across multiple years. We hope to have this
    feature in the next iteration.</p>

  <h2>Milestone Two</h2>
  <img src="milestone_two.png" id="five" />
  <p>By now, we have implemented all of our core goals we stated that we would achieve at the beginning of this project.
    Our visualization consists of four main features that work together to help users look at trends in gentrification.
    Users begin by selecting up to two gentrification attributes from the two dropdown menus at the top of our
    visualization. After selecting up to two subboroughs from the GeoJSON map below, data from 2005-2016 will be
    displayed in bar charts to the right of the map. Users can change the year for the data displayed using a slider
    control. For the bar chart visualization, the top two quadrants will
    represent the data for a specific subborough A, while the bottom two quadrants will represent the other selected
    Subborough B.
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of the GeoJSON map is not just to allow users to select specififc subboroughs they want to investigate,
    but also to help users see how some subboroughs might be more gentrified than others. We do this by normalizing the
    dataset from NYU and then adding these normalized values together to generate a "gentrification score", where a
    higher score means that there is more gentrification in an area. For example, if a user has selected the attributes
    "Median Household Income" and "Median Rent" for the year 2009, then our visual will get the appropriate normalized
    values for each attribute and add them together. The resulting sum will then be applied to a color scale and used to
    color the each subborough on the map. Darker colors will mean higher sums and more gentrification happening.</p>

  <p>
    Originally, we had wanted to create a timeseries line chart that displays the data for multiple attributes. We were
    unable to follow through with this idea, however, as different attribute had different units of measure (ex. dollars
    vs housing units). This led to inconsistent y-axes being constructed. Additionally, if we had a timeseries chart
    with two y-axes, each of different measure, this could lead to users identifying faulty trends in data that never
    existed in the first place. Our alternative solution, which ended up being
    better, is the 4-quadrant bar chart you see now. Users are still able to compare multiple attributes across
    different subboroughs, all while addressing the issue of different attributes having different units of measure.
    Based on the above screenshot, users can easily compare the Median Household Income of Starrett City and Borough
    Park, while at the same time also being able to look at the data concerning the population of both subboroughs.
    Because we keep the axes for each attribute seperate, users will not accidentially mis-identify trends in our data,
    compared to our previous line chart idea.
